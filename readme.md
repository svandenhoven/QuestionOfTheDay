# ‚ùìQuestions of the day

This application creates a Teams App where you can have a question of the day inside a meeting. This will give a question of the day to kickstart your meeting and to get everyone engaged.

This application can be used in Teams and outside of Teams. In Teams the application will use LiveShare where the fluid framework service of Teams will be used. Outside Teams it will use your own Fluid Relay Service.
